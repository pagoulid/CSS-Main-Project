Main CSS Project

    This project is about the design of a sample webpage.
    The structure consists of:

        - 1 main element containing 4 sections (1 hero section , 3 sub sections)
        - 1 footer element

Hero Structure:

    Hero consists of 2 flex containers in a row direction 
    where each one of them contains:
        - Logo , 3 header links
        - A content block(with a title,a paragraph,a button) , an image-placeholder block

Sub Section 1 Structure:

    Sub Section 1 consists of 1 header title and an unordered list as a flex container(with 4 list elements).
    Its list flex items are in a row direction.
    Each list flex item consists of :

        - 1 empty square block
        - 1 small paragraph text

Sub Section 2 Structure:

    Sub Section 2 consists of 1 content block containing a quote along with a reference, of who said the quote, 
    at the bottom of the relative text.

Sub Section 3 Structure:

    Sub Section 3 consists of 1 content block which contains 
    another block(action) that contains:

            - 1 title
            - 1 text 
            - 1 button

    The definition of a block(action) inside another block(content) was made due to positioning reasons.

Footer Structure:

    Footer consists of 1 content element which contains

            - 1 text(Copyright)
            - 1 block(sign) that contains the letter c

        The structure of the above sign block was made in order to 
        modify its borders so the block looks like a small circle along with 
        aligning its c letter content at the centre and finally designing 
        the copyright sign.
